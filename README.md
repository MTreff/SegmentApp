# SegmentApp

The service is based on the principle of semantic image segmentation. 
Implemented such functions as:

  - Selection of masks of objects of certain classes
  - Removing the background of selected objects
  - Convert the background of selected objects in grayscale
  - Blur the background of selected objects
  
The pre-trained neural network FCN - RESNET 101 from PyTorch library was used as a neural network segmenter.

The service is implemented as the final project of the first semester of Deep Learning School 2019-2020.
